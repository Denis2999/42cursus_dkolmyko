# 42cursus_dkolmyko

Welcome to my 42cursus repository! This repository showcases the projects I've completed during my time at 42 Warsaw, an innovative coding school renowned for its peer-to-peer learning environment and emphasis on practical programming skills.

## About 42
[42 Warsaw](https://42warsaw.pl/en/) challenges conventional education paradigms by offering a curriculum based solely on project-based learning. At 42, students, known as "cadets," tackle real-world coding challenges, collaborate with peers, and refine their problem-solving abilities in a dynamic and supportive community.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into directories corresponding to each project or module I've undertaken. Each directory contains the source code, documentation, and any relevant resources for the respective project.

## Projects Overview
- **0 Piscine**: Solutions to various exercises completed during the 42 School's coding bootcamp.
- **1 Libft**: Implementation of a custom standard C library, recreating various standard functions and adding new utility functions.
- **2.1 Get Next Line**: Development of a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, handling various edge cases and ensuring efficient memory usage.
